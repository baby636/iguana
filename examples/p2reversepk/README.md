# Example: P2ReversePk

Like a P2PK in a P2SH, but reverses the pubkey before doing a sigcheck (Chris Pacia Vietnam flashbacks)

## Usage:

1. in root, `cd examples/p2reversepk`
2. `cargo run`
3. in root, `cd iguana-ui`
4. `yarn install`
5. `yarn start`
6. Open up your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/.
7. Wait for the tx to arrive and then click on "Input #0".
8. You can now see the trace of the script.
